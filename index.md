Efforts and results are being recognized at both the State and national level as demonstrated by the recently released ["The Rural Edge"](https://ruralinnovation.us/resources/storytelling/rural-edge-traverse-city/) video from the Center on Rural Innovation.

But, with new leadership, the commitment to Experiential Learning, and a focus on innovation, opportunities innovation, entrepreneurship, and startup are expanding across the campus.
