An NMC Startup Year 2 project is proposed as the next iteration of this initiative. While Startup Week, 
the pitch event, and the course were successful, the goal of providing a cross-curricular startup and 
entrepreneurial experience was not. Of the ten MFG291 students, only two were from programs (Visual 
Communications) other than Engineering Technology. During the Year 2 project, promotion to other 
NMC programs will increase with additional clarity provided by Year 1 success stories. NMC Startup will 
integrate into NMC’s Experiential Learning initiative. A successful Year 2 will increase the number of 
NMC Startup teams, including students from a variety of NMC programs including Business, Engineering, 
Engineering Technology, and Visual Communications. Student teams will pitch at NM’s Experiential 
Learning Symposium, TCNewTech, and Northern Michigan Startup Week 2023

During the past year, efforts were accelerated by the creation of Northern 
Michigan Startup Week. The production of this event was a collaboration of community partners 
including 20Fathoms, Newton’s Road, TCNewTech, Northern Michigan Angels, and NMC. 
NMC always plays a crucial role in the area's economic development but support and engagement in  innovation, entrepreneurship and startup

What Is a Startup? 
The term startup refers to a company in the first stages of operations. Startups are 
founded by one or more entrepreneurs who want to develop a product or service for 
which they believe there is demand. These companies generally start with high costs 
and limited revenue, which is why they look for capital from a variety of sources such as 
venture capitalists.
