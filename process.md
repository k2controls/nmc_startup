## NMC Startup - Process/Approach Fall 2022 - Spring 2023

### Situation / Problem / Opportunity

The pilot MFG 291 Startup Seminar class delivered during the NMC Startup – Year 1 project was a success. NMC students experienced a new course with a focus on creativity and business value. Students identified problems or opportunities, formed teams, interacted with product customers, and created new value. Students interacted with the local Startup Community working closely with team mentors, pitching to event judges, and highlighting NMC learning to the community.

An NMC Startup Year 2 project is proposed as the next iteration of this initiative. While Startup Week, the pitch event, and the course were successful, the goal of providing a cross-curricular startup and entrepreneurial experience was not. Of the ten MFG291 students, only two were from programs (Visual Communications) other than Engineering Technology. During the Year 2 project, promotion to other NMC programs will increase with additional clarity provided by Year 1 success stories. A successful Year 2 will increase the number of NMC Startup teams, including students from a variety of NMC programs including Business, Engineering, Engineering Technology, and Visual Communications. NMC Startup will integrate into NMC’s Experiential Learning initiative. Student teams will pitch at NMC’s Experiential Learning Symposium, TCNewTech, and Northern Michigan Startup Week 2023.

### Project Goals
