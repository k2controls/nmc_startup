Traverse City's startup community continues to build momentum, creating new opportunities for business and career growth. Efforts and results are being recognized at both the State and national level as demonstrated by the recently released ["The Rural Edge"](https://ruralinnovation.us/resources/storytelling/rural-edge-traverse-city/) video from the Center on Rural Innovation. 

NMC Student startups have evolved from select classroom efforts as shared by Matt Gottard in The Rural Edge video. But with changes in leadership, the focus on Experiential Learning, and a focus on innovation, opportunities innovation, entrepreneurship, and startup are expanding across the campus.

*Our Story

During the past year, efforts were accelerated by the creation of [Northern Michigan Startup Week](assets/sp22/NMSW_follow-up_article.pdf). The production of this event was a collaboration of community partners including 20Fathoms, Newton’s Road, TCNewTech, Northern Michigan Angels, and NMC.  

While NMC supported multiple events including Space Night and Techstars Startup Weekend, the Student Pitch Competition was primary. This competitive event featured four high school presentations followed by five NMC Startup pitches. Nine MFG 291 Startup Seminar students took the City Opera House stage to present their Minimal Viable Products (MVP) and related business plans created during this pilot class.

Northern Michigan Startup Week, the Student Pitch Competition, and the MFG291 Special Topics course were big successes providing an opportunity for NMC to showcase future-focused education along with 
community partnerships and engagement. Feedback from team mentors, event judges and our startup community was very positive. A post-event survey to attendees resulted in a 4.43 out of 5 rating.

The pilot MFG 291 class provided a new experience for NMC students and demonstrated that processes supporting innovation and value creation can be taught. Students identified problems or opportunities, formed teams, interacted with potential customers, and created products or services, validated, and pitched. Student analyze and evaluate using common business tools including Design Thinking, Lean Canvas, and Agile Project Management. This Experiential Learning course is future-focused education, embedding “21st Century Skills” that prepare students for an increasingly complex work environment. 

NMC Startup is an educational startup. Our goal is to iterate quickly to maximize value to our customer and as we begin year two of the project, we're returning to step one of the [Design Thinking process](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/design-thinking-process/) with a focus on our customer. Who is the customer? Yes, our broader Startup community, but if NMC Startup is to be a diverse, cross-campus solution, then iteration must engage NMC users. Student, teachers, administration - we need to talk to you. How do you see innovation, creation, and business value supporting your educational goals?
