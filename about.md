## Our Story

During the past year, Startup efforts were accelerated by the creation of [Northern Michigan Startup Week](assets/sp22/NMSW_follow-up_article.pdf). The project was based on the early success of a 2014 Startup Weekend event hosted at Northwestern Michigan College. Keith Kelly of NMC and Bradley Matson of Northern Michigan Angels convened a planning team and [nmsw.co](https://nmsw.co) was born. The final event-filled week was a collaboration of community partners including TCNewTech, 20Fathoms, Newton’s Road, Northern Michigan Angels, and NMC.  

While NMC supported multiple events during the week including Space Night and Techstars Startup Weekend, Friday's Student Pitch Competition was primary. This competitive event featured four high school presentations followed by five NMC Startup pitches. NMC teams created Minimal Viable Products (MVP) and worked with mentor to refine their value proposition. The five minute "Pitch" was refined and presented to the community on stage at the City Opera House. A five Q&A period followed enabling event judges to interact with teams and to award first and second place awards of $1000 and $500.

> **What Is a Startup?** 
>The term startup refers to a company in the first stages of operations. Startups are founded by one or more entrepreneurs who want to develop a product or service for which they believe there is demand. These companies generally start with high costs and limited revenue, which is why they look for capital from a variety of sources such as venture capitalists. 

Northern Michigan Startup Week, the Student Pitch Competition, and the Special Topics course were big successes providing an opportunity for NMC to showcase future-focused education along with community partnerships and engagement. Feedback from team mentors, event judges and our startup community was very positive. A post-event survey to attendees resulted in a 4.43 out of 5 rating.

The pilot NMC class provided a new experience for NMC students and demonstrated that processes supporting innovation and value creation can be taught. Students identified problems or opportunities, formed teams, interacted with potential customers, and created products or services, validated, and pitched. Student analyze and evaluate using common business tools including Design Thinking, Lean Canvas, and Agile Project Management. This Experiential Learning course is future-focused education, embedding “21st Century Skills” that prepare students for an increasingly complex work environment. 

NMC Startup is an educational startup. Our goal is to iterate quickly to maximize value to our customer. As we begin year two of the project, we're returning to step one of the [Design Thinking process](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/design-thinking-process/) with a focus on our customer. Who is the customer? Yes, our broader Startup community, but if NMC Startup is to be a diverse, cross-campus solution, then iteration must engage NMC users. Student, teachers, administration - we need to talk to you. How do you see innovation, creation, and business value supporting your educational goals? How can a cross-campus startup course fit into program goals and schedules?
